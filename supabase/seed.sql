-- Production seed file
-- This file contains only essential data for the application to function
-- All test data has been removed for production use

-- Note: This file is intentionally minimal
-- Real data will be created through:
-- 1. User registration via the /register page
-- 2. Agency creation during user registration
-- 3. Client management through the dashboard
-- 4. Integration data from connected platforms

-- No seed data is inserted in production
-- The application will start with a clean database
